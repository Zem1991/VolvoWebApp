# VolvoWebApp
This is a programming exercise required for admittance at Volvo, for a position as Professional Software Engineer.
Made using:
- .NET 8 for the MVC
- EntityFramework Core (for SQL Server)
- AutoMapper
- Bootstrap
- Fontawesome
- xUnit
- Moq

## Instructions
1. Download/clone this repository, then run it.
2. Viewing records can be done without loging in, but creating/updating/deleting will require registering first. Only an email and password is needed, and these will be stored within the project's own database.

## About
All the required features and business rules were implemented. The only extras would be:
- Very basic Authorization/Registering (already described)
- Additional fields for Id, Created Date and Last Update
- Records sorted by Last Update (descending order)
- Record deletion
